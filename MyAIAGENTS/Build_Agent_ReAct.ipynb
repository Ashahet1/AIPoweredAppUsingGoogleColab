    "### **🔹 Simple Summary of This Code **\n",
    "\n",
    "This code defines an **AI chatbot agent** that interacts with users by remembering previous conversations and generating responses using **GPT-4o**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How It Works:**\n",
    "1. **`Agent` Class**  \n",
    "   - When an agent is created, it can have an optional **system message** (like a personality or instruction).\n",
    "   - It also keeps track of conversation history in `self.messages`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`__call__` Method (`agent(\"Hello\")` behaves like calling a chatbot)**  \n",
    "   - When a user sends a message, it gets added to the chat history.\n",
    "   - The agent **calls GPT-4o to generate a response**.\n",
    "   - The response is then added to the conversation history.\n",
    "   - The reply is returned to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`execute()` Method**  \n",
    "   - This function sends the stored messages to OpenAI's `GPT-4o` model.\n",
    "   - It gets the **assistant's response** and returns it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example Usage:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "agent = Agent(\"You are a helpful assistant.\")\n",
    "response = agent(\"What is the capital of France?\")\n",
    "print(response)  # Expected output: \"The capital of France is Paris.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **In short:**  \n",
    "This code **creates a chatbot** that keeps a conversation history and responds using OpenAI’s GPT-4o model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know if you need further simplifications! 🚀"

    "This function **interacts with an AI chatbot (Agent)**, asking a question and processing responses **up to 5 times**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔸 How It Works:**\n",
    "1. **Starts a chatbot (`Agent`) and asks a question**.\n",
    "2. **Loops up to `max_turns` (default: 5)**:\n",
    "   - Sends a message to the chatbot.\n",
    "   - Prints the response.\n",
    "   - Checks if the response contains an \"action command\".\n",
    "3. **If an action is detected:**\n",
    "   - Runs the corresponding function from `known_actions`.\n",
    "   - Uses the result (observation) as the next prompt.\n",
    "4. **If no action is found, it stops.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔹 Example in Simple Terms**\n",
    "Imagine it's a **conversation bot** that can also **execute commands**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "query(\"What’s the weather like?\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The bot might reply: `\"Action: get_weather: New York\"`\n",
    "- The function detects `\"get_weather\"` and executes the relevant function.\n",
    "- The bot gets the weather and replies with: `\"Observation: Sunny and 75°F\"`\n",
    "- If there's no more action, it stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **In short:** This function keeps asking the chatbot for responses, executes detected actions, and stops if no more actions are found.\n"
